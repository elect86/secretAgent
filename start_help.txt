Version 0.01
	Can load levels, some of them are broken.
	On island map you can move on the map (arrows), use teleport and enter buildings (space).
	In level you can move (arrows), collect items, push cans, jump (right shift), use doors and other things (space), exit to island (escape).

1. Java
	Make sure you have JRE 7 or higher, you can download it here:
	http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

2. LWJGL
	The libraries should be included in the zip, if you get an error, you can download them here:
	http://lwjgl.org/download.php
	Or google for them.
	
	Download file lwjgl-2.9.0.zip (or higher version), the binaries are in:
	lwjgl-2.9.0.zip/native/
	
	Find dlls for your system, i.e. win64:
	lwjgl-2.9.0.zip/natives/windows/
		jinput-dx8_64.dll
		jinput-raw_64.dll
		lwjgl64.dll
		OpenAL64.dll
	
	Copy the files to the game root directory and everything should work.

3. More maps
	TODO

4. Troubleshooting
	Started application, but console window just flashed (or nothing happened):
		Run the application from console, you will see the error
		Probably missing Java
	Started application, there was console window with appending text for a few seconds, then it closed:
		Check log/log.txt, if empty, run from console to see the error
