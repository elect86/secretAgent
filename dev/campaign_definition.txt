Campaign definition file.

The format is standard .properties file.
The file must be in directory data/campaigns or else it won't be loaded by the game.
The properties are:
	title - name of the campaign
	description - long description of the campaign
	bgColor - background color decoded by Color.decode, preferred format is 0xRRGGBB (not required)
	levelTilesFile - file containing default level tiles (id = 0)
	addedTileFiles - list of additional level tile files (not required)
		If tile file id > 0, then the tiles are used user in maps.
		If tile file id < 0, then rewrites some existing HUG or GUI file.
			-1: GUI window sprites
			-2: health bar
	modelsFiles - list of files (without id defined by *) that contain additional model definitions
		If more files contain a model with same name, will be rewritten by the last
	islandMapFile - file with island map
	levelMapFiles - list of level files
		Level maps are indexed from 1 and the sequence must be complete.

	The tile and sprite files always refer to the image, not definition.
	File list is in format: [id]*[file_path];[id]*[file_path];[id]*[file_path]
	
	
	File paths are within the data/ directory.
	
	Example:
		levelMapFiles=	1*orig/e1l1.sam;\
						2*orig/e1l2.sam;\
						3*orig/e1l3.sam;
		addedTileFiles=	6*tiles/6set.gif; 13*tiles/13tiles.bmp
		modelFiles=definitions/orig_models.txt; awesome_models.txt
